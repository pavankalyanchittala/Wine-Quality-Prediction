![Wine Quality Prediction (ML)- Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/pavankalyanchittala/Wine-Quality-Prediction/assets/117903644/403b7a0c-99e9-457b-9ad0-9e34512ddd12)



The dataset, I taken  from Kaggle contains the wine quality dataset that use for this project. This dataset likely includes various features such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and other relevant information. By utilizing linear regression, you can train a machine learning model on this dataset to predict the quality of wine based on these features.

To get started, you can download the dataset from the provided link and explore its contents. Make sure to preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if any, and splitting it into training and testing sets. Then, you can train a linear regression model using the training data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.

Remember to perform feature selection or engineering if necessary to improve the model's accuracy. Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to predict the quality of wine for new, unseen data.
